# React Projects
### Projects I am building while learning React.  
&nbsp;

**1. [CounterApp-Classes](https://github.com/0rGaan1c/React_Projects/tree/main/1.CounterApp-Classes).**
* A very simple counter app made using React classes.
&nbsp;

**2. [Todo-Classes](https://github.com/0rGaan1c/React_Projects/tree/main/2.ToDo-Classes)**
* A Todo app made using React classes.
&nbsp;

**3. [TicTacToe](https://github.com/0rGaan1c/React_Projects/tree/main/3.tictactoe)**
* A classic TicTacToe game 
&nbsp;

**4. [A Good Looking Todo App](https://github.com/0rGaan1c/React_Projects/tree/main/4.ImprovedToDo)**
* Again, A todomap but with more features this time.

**5. [FanWiki](https://github.com/0rGaan1c/React_Projects/tree/main/5.fanwiki)**
* A Naruto FanWiki app which list out all the characters of Naruto anime series.
* It's a very basic version with very basic design and might have a lot of bugs.
* If you have any suggestion please let me know.
* I might improve this app in the future.

**6. [Pok√©dex](https://github.com/0rGaan1c/React_Projects/tree/main/6.pokedex)**
* A simple Pokedex app.
* This project is quite similar to the fanwiki.

**7. [Weather](https://github.com/0rGaan1c/React_Projects/tree/main/6.weather)**
* A simple weather app.
* I learned about useRef becuase I didn't wanted the useEffect hook to run on initial render.
